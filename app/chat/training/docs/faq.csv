You see in your Unit Outline that the assignment is weighted at 50% of the final mark and the mid-semester test is weighted at 10% of the final mark. Ultimately, this means that if you score 20 out of 30 for both pieces of assessment, the mid-semester test contributes 6.6 marks (20/30 of 10 marks) and the major assignment contributes 33.3 marks (20/30 of 50 marks) to your final result."

Pre-ordering your transcript
You can pre-order your academic transcript on studentConnect up to 45 days before your final results have been released, or once you have completed your course and been assigned a graduation ceremony. Pre-ordered paper documents will be available to collect two working days after the release of results; for digital documents you will receive an email after your graduation ceremony to confirm that your document is online and ready for you to access via a registration link for your personalised My eQuals portal. If you order a hardcopy transcript to be collected from Student Central, you will not receive an email to let you know when your document is ready to be collected as the processing times listed on the website are guaranteed. 
Orders and collections are unavailable during the University shutdown period."
"Can I receive an electronic copy of my Statement of Academic Record?","Students have the option to order a digital version of their UWA Statement of Academic Record (transcript) issued via My eQuals. Digital documents issued via My eQuals are securely stored and available to you anytime and anywhere, saving you time and money.
Once UWA has uploaded your requested document, you can use My eQuals to safely share your documents with anyone, at any time, for however long you like. When you share a document from the repository, the person you invite to view your document will receive an email directly from My eQuals (Digitary) and not from your student email account. This is how external organisations can know this is a legitimate document coming from the secure repository.
You still have the option to order a paper (hard copy) version of your Statement of Academic Record and other official academic documents.
Hard copy academic documents and records are printed on official UWA secure paper. In order to maintain the integrity of these documents, to verify that they are authentic, and to avoid fraudulent alterations they cannot be emailed. Once you have received a hard copy document, you can then scan your own copy as required. Authenticated soft-copy academic documents can be ordered and will be available via My eQuals."
"What is a Statement of Qualification?","A Statement of Qualification (or Letter of Completion) is an official hardcopy University document that can be used as evidence that you have completed the requirements of your course of study, and is often used by students who have completed their studies but not yet graduated. This statement does not include information of any studies undertaken at CELT (Centre for English Language Teaching) or UWA College.
 
The Statement of Qualification is printed on official UWA secure paper and signed by the Associate Director, Student Services & Engagement. The document states:

Your full name
Your student ID
Your courses
The dates you commenced and completed your award/s
The date of your graduation/s (if applicable)
Confirmation that all instruction at the University of Western Australia is taught in English

Current students can order and pay for their Statement via studentConnect. Past graduates can use the online portal for order and payment.
 
Statements of Qualification are produced as hard copy documents only. If you would like a digital document, you may wish to order a Statement of Academic Record, or wait until you graduate when you'll receive free access to a digital copy of your degree certificate and AHEGS via My eQuals."
"I have completed my course and want to apply for Australian Permanent Residency. What documentation do I need?","When you apply for Australian Permanent Residency you may need to order documents from Student Central to support your application, such as a Statement of Academic Record and/or a Statement of Qualification. 
It’s a good idea for you to check with the Department of Home Affairs to find out exactly what documentation you will need.
You can see examples of documents on our current student website, and can place your order through the Online Portal."
"Can I order express documents?","Student Central provides Express and Next Day services for documents you require urgently. Due to processing times, the option to order express or next day services varies depending on the document type.

Express orders will be ready three University working hours after we receive your completed order via the Online Portal or in person at Student Central.
Next day orders will be ready by 12:00pm the following University business day after we receive your completed order via the Online Portal or in person at Student Central.

You can see samples of our documents, prices, delivery options, and information on how to place an order on our Academic documents web page.
Documents can be collected during Student Administration opening hours, and are not available to order or collect over the University shutdown period."
